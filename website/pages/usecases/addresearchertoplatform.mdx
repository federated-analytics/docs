# Adding a researcher to the platform

To fully add a researcher to the TRE-FX platform
they need to both be given an account to the Keycloak user management system,
and to be added to the people records in the TRE-FX submission layer.
Their records across these are implicitly associated by their `username`.

## Prerequisites

Required information:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email address

## Workflow


<Steps>
### Researcher requests account on platform.

The researcher fills out a request form for an account on the service.

<Callout>
This step is needed, but out of scope for this documentation.
</Callout>

### Request is approved.

The request is approved.
**At this point a `username` should be defined for the researcher**.
The researcher should sign any user agreements 
that might be required for accessing the TRE-FX submission layer.

<Callout>
This step is needed, but out of scope for this documentation.

### [Add the researcher to KeyCloak](/activities/keycloakAdminAddingNewUser)

The groups that the user should be allocated to should be defined before this step.

<Callout>
The order in which the steps for creating user accounts are taken is not critical.
