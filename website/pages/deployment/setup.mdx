### Login
There are three layers : `Submission` `Egress` and `TRE` 

- The **Submission Layer** is hosted at `localhost:7220`
- The **TRE Layer** is hosted at `localhost:8989 `
- The **Egress Layer** is hosted at `localhost:8100`

For the All In One demo purposes there is a pre-set TRE, Project and user created and assigned.
There is also a demo admin user created to log in to all three layers:
```
Username: globaladminuser

Password: password123
```
Skip to the [project approval section](#submission) if you already have a TRE, Project and user set up in the Submission Layer.
If you need to create them first then follow the steps below.

### Create a TRE
Navigate to the ***TRE*** tab in the Submission Layer.

<Callout> The admin username has to match the existing keycloak username for that TRE. </Callout>


### Create a User
You can create a user by navigating to ***People-> Create New User***.
For the All In One the username would be `globaladminuser`

<Callout> The username has to match the an existing keycloak user account.</Callout>

Once a Project is created, assign a TRE and a user that will be associated with the submissions.

### TRE layer
The TRE layer will sync any Projects created in the submission layer. This will take up to 10 minutes.

### Approve Project and Membership
Once the Project is visible in the TRE Layer then the Project and the user membership needs to be approved for the TRE to accept submissions on that Project from the approved user.
