Once a Project is created, assign a TRE and a user that will be associated with the submissions.

### TRE layer
The TRE layer will sync any Projects created in the submission layer. This may take up to 10 minutes.

### Approve Project and Membership
Once the Project is visible in the TRE UI then the Project and the user membership needs to be approved for the TRE to accept submissions on that Project from the approved user.
