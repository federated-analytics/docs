## Funnel TES

[Funnel](https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/funnel) is an implementation of the GA4GH Task Execution Schemas. It provides an API server, 
multiple storage backends, multiple compute backends and a web UI.
For the purposes of the All In One stack we will be configuring the TRE Agent to use Funnel as the TES compatible execution backend and any outputs from the execution will be stored in the TRE Layer MinIO instance.

<Steps>

### Set up MinIO Access key
Navigate to the TRE layer MinIO instance, hosted at `http://localhost:9002` and create access key credentials.
The MinIO login credentials for the All In One Demo version are:
```
Username: minio
Password: minio123
```
Note the name of the TRE output bucket of the Project that you want to submit to. The naming pattern is: ` <projectName> + <uniqueID> + outputtre`. You will need to reference this in the `outputs` section in the[ TES message](#submit-a-tes-message)

### Install funnel
Instructions on how to install Funnel can be found [here](https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel/download/)

<Callout> It is currently only available on linux and macOS.</Callout>

### Funnel config file
Funnel will need access to the TRE layer MinIO. 
Create a yaml file, point it to the instance of MinIO in the TRE Layer and set the access key & secret created in the previous step.

```yaml filename="config.yml"
GenericS3:
  - Disabled: false
    Endpoint: "localhost:9002" // URL where the MinIO instance is hosted.
    Key: “<access key>”
    Secret: “<secret>"  
```

### Run Funnel
Run the funnel server using the config created above.

```bash copy
funnel server run -c config.yml
```

### Set Funnel as the TES API for All In One
In the All In One repository change these settings in the ***.env*** file:
```bash copy
UseTESK = true
```
In the ***docker-compose.yml*** set:
```bash copy
// Set all instances of DemoMode and KeycloakDemoMode in the file to:
DemoMode = false
KeyCloakDemoMode = true

// In the tre-api section set:
TESKAPIURL = "http://localhost:8000/v1/tasks" or "http://host.docker.internal:8000/v1/tasks" // point to the funnel server TASK API, if trying to access from inside docker you need to use host.docker.internal
TESKOutputBucketPrefix = "s3://" // set the prefix for GenericS3 storage
```

### Submit a TES message
Once the Funnel is running and the All In One is up and configured, you can submit a TES payload to the Submission Layer.

#### Get Access Token
From the Submission Layer navigate to ***API Access Token -> Copy to Clipboard***

#### Authorise request
You can make the request from the swagger API hosted at `http://localhost:5034/swagger`.
Authorise the request with the Token from the ***Authorise*** button on the top right.

More information on the TES payload can be found at the TES API [specification](https://ga4gh.github.io/task-execution-schemas/docs/#tag/TaskService/operation/CreateTask) website.

```bash copy

POST localhost:5034/v1/tasks
{
    "state": 0,
    "name": "Hello world",
    "inputs": [
        {
            "url": "s3://<TREOutputBucket>/hello.txt",
            "path": "/inputs/hello.txt"
        }
    ],
    "outputs": [
        {
            "url": "s3://<TREOutputBucket>/output.txt", // TREOutputBucket needs to match the bucket name from Step 1
            "path": "/outputs/stdout"
        }
    ],
    "executors": [
        {
            "image": "alpine",
            "command": [
                "cat",
                "/inputs/hello.txt"
            ],
            "stdout": "/outputs/stdout"
        }
    ],
    "volumes": null,
    "tags": {
        "project": "<ProjectName>", // Project that you would like to submit to.
        "tres": "<TREName>" // TRE related to that Project
    },
    "logs": null,
    "creation_time": null
}

```
