# Stack Components

The All In One stack provides a number of services which would
usually be hosted separately, but are combined together here
for the convenience of users.

Below these are listed, along with a short description of their function,
and with the local web addresses and user accounts.
Note that these user accounts are only intended for local training purposes.
If you deploy this stack for public access then these must be changed.
