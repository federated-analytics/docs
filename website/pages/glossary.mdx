# Glossary of Terms

This is a placeholder page, which will contain a glossary of terms.

# Actors
- **User Manager:** This is the manager of the Keycloak server. They deal with user accounts for all services.
- **TRE Manager:** This is the manager of a TRE server. They deal with project and user approvals, as well as connecting to the Egress server.
- **Submission Manager:** This is the manager of the submission layer. They create projects and people, and assign people to projects.
- **Egress Manager:** This is the manager of the egress layer. They deal with approving data release from TREs.
- **Researcher:** This is the researcher using the service. They will use the submission layer to submit new tasks to be run in the TREs.

# TECHNOLOGY
- **API (Application Programming Interface):** This comprises of guidelines, and protocols that enable software applications to interact with each other by specifying the techniques and data structures for requesting and sharing information.
- **Application Stack:** This is a collection of software technologies and tools that collaborate to develop and operate an application efficiently and effectively.
- **Database:** This is a collection of data that is organised, stored and managed electronically.
- **Database Credentials:** These are required pieces of information that allows an individual or an application to access a database. This usually comprises of a Username( the identifier for the user of the application), Password ( A secret key known to the user/users associated with the username to authenticate access).
- **Docker Compose:** This is a tool for defining and running multi container applications.It allows user to launch an entire application stack using the configuration YAML file.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** This is a user interface where the interaction is with the device or computer is done by the use of visual elements like icons, windows, menus and buttons.
- **Kubernetes:** Abbreviated as K8. This is an open-source platform that helps manage and automate the deployment, scaling and operations of containers.
- **MinIO:** "This is a software application that provides storage space that allows for the storage of large amounts of data.
In a TRE-FX context, it is used as an intermediary storage layer for holding the Five Safes RO-Crates during ingress and egress.
- **Open source:** This is a software with a code that can be assessed, maintained and improved through open collaboration.
- **PostgressSQL 14:** A database which uses tables (row and columns to store data).This is used for storing essential data. i.e. Which users have been authorised to run analyses against which projects, task statuses.
- **Repository:** A storage location where project assets such as requirements, code, files are managed and stored. It assists in maintaining a structured development process.
- **REST API:** Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.
- **Workflow Agnostic:** This is a tool or technology that is meant to be compatible with processes, workflows without restriction to a single method or approach.

# TRUSTED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT / HEALTH RESEARCH
- **Data Anonymisation:** This is the removal or protection of any identifiable personal information from datasets.
- **Data Provenance:** This refers to the history and origin of data.
- **Dataset:** A collection of data, often structured in columns and rows( tabular form). Datasets can differ in sizes from a few records to billon of data points.
- **Egress:** This refers to data leaving an environment or a network system.
- **Egress Layer:** In TRE-FX context, the egress layer serves as a temporary holding space for data returned from the Trusted Research Environment which needs to be authorised for release before being passed to the Submission Layer.
- **FAIR:** Findable, Acceptable, Interoperable and Re-usable. This is a framework used in the research space.
- **Federated Activities (Trusted Research Environment):** This a network of TRE institutions that collaborate among themselves without compromising data privacy and security.
- **Federated Query:** This involves getting data from multiple databases as if it were one single database.
- **HUTCH:** This is an open-source tool designed to facilitate federated activities- such as analytics, data discovery and machine learning within secure environments.
- **Ingress:** This refers to data entering a system or a network. 
- **Manager (TRE/Submission/Egress):** The person or entity responsible for managing a particular service within the TRE infrastructure.
- **Metadata:** Data describing the data.It provides information about the origin, version and other information about the data set.
- **OMOP:** Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
- **Payload:** In the context of TRE-FX, payload is data sent from client and server in API requests and responses.
- **Project:** A project in this context is an approved piece of work submitted for analysis in a Trusted Research Environment. This process involves going through the required governance guidelines.
- **Project Bucket:** A project bucket is the list of all the tasks that have been submitted towards a project on TRE-FX.
- **Research Data:** This refers to information that has been collected, analysed and generated during the process of a research project or scientific investigation. Research data can be collected via processes such as interviews, survey results, clinical trial outcomes, or chemical analysis.
- **RO Crate:** A transport format to bundle metadata for submission along with required input parameters and everything implementation needs to know in order to perform the requested analysis
It is a methodology of packaging research data, with it's associated metedata and it's components and files."
- **SDE:** Secure Data Environment- a platform where sensitive health and care data is stored securely which can be used for research and analysis.
- **Submission Layer:** In TRE-FX contex, the submission layer serves as the intial point of contact for incoming analytical tasks, responsible for receiving user-submitted tasks, performing preliminary validation and queuing the tasks for further processing.
- **Task:** A request submitted by a submission layer User as part of a project, for some analysis or computation within one or more Trusted Research Environments.
- **TRE (Trusted Research Environment):** This is a secure digital environment that has valuable de-identified health and care data that can only be accessed by approved researchers.
- **TRE Controller Layer:** This is the outer layer of the TRE, responsible for task scheduling, data coordination and messaging between the different layers of the TRE.
- **TRE-UI:** This is the user interface that offers an integrated view of ongoing tasks, logs and system metrics.
- **TRINO:** This is a distributed SQL query engine designed to query large data sets distributed over one or more heterogeneous data sources.
- **User (Submission Layer):** This is a person who has been authorised to use the submission layer. They may be associated with one or more projects.
- **Wizard UI:** A user interface that guides users through a series of steps to complete, allowing the user to break down complex processes into small steps to achieve a goal.
