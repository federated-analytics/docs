This is a placeholder page, which will contain a glossary of terms.
# TECHNOLOGY

- **API (Application Programming Interface):** This comprises of guidelines, and protocols that enable software applications to interact with each other by specifying the techniques and data structures for requesting and sharing information.
- **Application Stack:** This is a collection of software technologies and tools that collaborate to develop and operate an application efficiently and effectively.
- **Database:** This is a collection of data that is organised, stored and managed electronically.
- **Database Credentials:** These are required pieces of information that allows an individual or an application to access a database. This usually comprises of a Username( the identifier for the user of the application), Password ( A secret key known to the user/users associated with the username to authenticate access).
- **Docker Compose:** This is a tool for defining and running multi container applications.It allows user to launch an entire application stack using the configuration YAML file.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** This is a user interface where the interaction is with the device or computer is done by the use of visual elements like icons, windows, menus and buttons.
- **Kubernetes:** Abbreviated as K8. This is an open-source platform that helps manage and automate the deployment, scaling and operations of containers.
- **MinIO:** "This is a software application that provides storage space that allows for the storage of large amounts of data.
In a TRE-FX context, it is used as an intermediary storage layer for holding the Five Safes RO-Crates during ingress and egress.
- **Open source:** This is a software with a code that can be assessed, maintained and improved through open collaboration.
- **PostgressSQL 14:** A database which uses tables (row and columns to store data).This is used for storing essential data. i.e. Which users have been authorised to run analyses against which projects, task statuses.
- **Repository:** A storage location where project assets such as requirements, code, files are managed and stored. It assists in maintaining a structured development process.
- **REST API:** Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.
- **Workflow Agnostic:** This is a tool or technology that is meant to be compatible with processes, workflows without restriction to a single method or approach.
# TRUSTED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT/ HEALTH RESEARCH
- **Data Anonymisation:** This is the removal or protection of any identifiable personal information from datasets.
- **Data Provenance:** This refers to the history and origin of data.
- **Dataset:** A collection of data, often structured in columns and rows( tabular form). Datasets can differ in sizes from a few records to billon of data points.
- **Egress:** This refers to data leaving an environment or a network system.
- **Egress Layer:** In TRE-FX context, the egress layer serves as a temporary holding space for data returned from the Trusted Research Environment which needs to be authorised for release before being passed to the Submission Layer.
- **FAIR:** Findable, Acceptable, Interoperable and Re-usable. This is a framework used in the research space.
- **Federated Activities (Trusted Research Environment):** This a network of TRE institutions that collaborate among themselves without compromising data privacy and security.
- **Federated Query:** This involves getting data from multiple databases as if it were one single database.
- **HUTCH:** This is an open-source tool designed to facilitate federated activities- such as analytics, data discovery and machine learning within secure environments.
- **Ingress:** This refers to data entering a system or a network. 
- **Manager (TRE/Submission/Egress):** The person or entity responsible for managing a particular service within the TRE infrastructure.
- **Metadata:** Data describing the data.It provides information about the origin, version and other information about the data set.
